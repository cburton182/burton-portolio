# Chris Burton Portfolio

I've recently picked up Sass, along with more advanced skills in CSS, and this portfolio project is the result of all the new concepts I've learned!

I'm hoping that this portfolio will not only showcase the projects I'm proud of, but also the knowledge I've gained in CSS and web design.

More commits to come as well as a more detailed readme! Thanks for checking out this project.
